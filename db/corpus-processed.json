            "body": "\nPiazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:\n\n Ask questions!\n\nThe best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\nEdit questions and answers wiki-style.\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors\u2019 answer for instructors).\n\n Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n Go anonymous.\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n Tag your posts.\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n Format code and equations.\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n View and download class details and resources. \n\nClick the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com. We love feedback!",

I have all the installations on my flashdrive and I was able to get to the Ubuntu trial menu. Now supposedly during the installation process there's supposed to be an option to run Ubuntu alongside Windows, but in my installation Ubuntu only gives me the options to erase Windows or to set the partitions myself. I'm not sure why the option won't show up, but I might assume it has to do with my hardrive storage. My OS (C:) has 1.8 TB of available space and 0.2 of that is used up by personal files (software, images, games, etc.). I was wondering if anyone has ever run into this issue before and was able to resolve the issue. If so, any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance,\u00a0\n\nIsaiah\n\nP.S. I'm in no rush to get this setup as I'm fine with using on-campus PCs to get my hw done if necessary, but I would like to get this resolved at some point.\u00a0",

I found a guide that might help, it explains how to create each partition (root, swap and home). I haven't followed it all the way through, but you might find it useful.\n\nhttps://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/\n\nUPDATE: I followed the tutorial to the end and my dual-boot of Ubuntu and Windows is working nicely.\n\nUPDATE (by the author of this question): I followed the instructions above and it worked! One thing I would want to warn people about though. If you are like me, you'll have a Windows with UEFI secure boot and you'll need to turn it off to dual boot. When I disabled it, while I was able to use Ubuntu just fine, I was unable to access my Windows OS because it asked for a BitLocker recovery key (you get asked this for disabling secure boot). If you are NOT SURE where you have your BitLocker key ID, make sure you find it BEFORE you install Ubuntu, because if you are unable to find your recovery key, you will NOT br able to access your Windows OS. I luckly found it on my Microsoft account (on a seperate PC) and so I was fine, but for those of you who are unsure where to find your recovery key, go here:\n\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026181/windows-10-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key\n\nAnd here:\nhttps://youtu.be/AZlGZLDWnIQ\n\nHope this helps.\n"

You can have individual, small, methods that you can easily figure out what they do, rather than needing tons of comments or to figure out what the code is doing. This helps with figuring out errors too.\nYou don't need to know how a method is implemented in order to use it. Java itself includes hundreds of built-in methods that you can use without knowing the details of how they work on a system level (System.out.println(), String.equals(), Math.round(), etc.) This is called abstraction."

This brings me to my final question: how would you be able to find instances of the old character without being able to access it within the replaceSingle method? I'm a little confused here.\n\nAlso, there appears to be a disparity between the instructions for implementation of the replaceSingle method between the comments in the java file and on the Google Doc. In the java comments, it says the method should replace the character at a specified index with a new character, but on the Google Doc, it says the method should replace a specific instance of a specified character with another.

You can round to any number of decimal places by doing this with 10 to the power of however many decimal places you need (I used this strategy in lab 2, just with 100.0 so it would round to 2 decimal places).\n\n\nTo add on to this, the root problem of the code provided initially is that the number would be rounded to a whole integer every time, as you are only multiplying/dividing by 1000, not 1000.0. This can be fixed by either dividing by 1000.0, like above, or by type casting the Math.round operation to a double, as Math.round outputs an int by default."

Therefore, by the end of our loop, our cur pointer isn't pointing to a ListNode object and so it should throw an error if we call cur.next right? Just wanted to see if I'm right on this..\n",

            "body": "\nPiazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:\n\n Ask questions!\n\nThe best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\nEdit questions and answers wiki-style.\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors\u2019 answer for instructors).\n\n Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n Go anonymous.\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n Tag your posts.\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n Format code and equations.\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n View and download class details and resources. \n\nClick the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com.

            "body": "\nPiazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:\n\n Ask questions!\n\nThe best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\nEdit questions and answers wiki-style.\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors\u2019 answer for instructors).\n\n Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n Go anonymous.\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n Tag your posts.\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n Format code and equations.\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n View and download class details and resources. \n\nClick the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com.

Note that is not\n// necessary to call the method toString, why?\nDo you understand the last line? When we use:\nSystem.out.println(objectA)\nThis will immediately invoke the toString() method of objectA. Every object in java has a toString method, it looks like this:\n// Code of Object.toString()\npublic String toString() {\n    return getClass().getName() + \"@\" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());\n}\nThis is probably the hashcode you're describing. Note the code above, it returns a String value, it doesn't do any printing. So, explicitly, when you do toString of an objectA, this is what happens:\nSystem.out.println(objectA);\nString printOut = objectA.toString();System.out.println(printOut);\nNote that I only wrote it out like this to be very explicit in what is occurring, this isn't necessarily what's happening in the background.So back to your question at hand. If when trying to print objectA out and we're getting hashcode, this must mean that toString isn't overriden in objectA. Double check that your toString method is defined in Circle, returns the valid type, and also that these changes are saved. (For example, editing toString but not saving the file, so the edited version is not being compiled, but eclipse may do this by default).Please let me know if this doesn't solve your issue or if I said something unclear!\u00a0\n\n"

A good example of this polymorphism is the `toString` function.\n\nEvery class type in Java has its own toString function; the default just prints that weird hash thing. However, if you write the method in your own class, then it'll override that default. String's `+` operator takes advantage of this - if you do:\n\nString s = \"Hello \" + someObject;\n\nThen Java will turn this into\n\nString s = \"Hello \" + someObject.toString();\n\nSo if we overload `toString` on the Circle type, then `\"Circle1=\" + circle1` will call `circle1.toString()` to get the representation of that circle as a string.\n\nNote: the rest of this post is just informational, if you're curious. You don't have to know this, and if you're a little confused, that's fine :)\n\nIf you wanted to take advantage of this for yourself, you'd write some base class (for `toString`, that base class is `Object`, which is the base class of all class types):\n\nclass Shape {    virtual public float area() {        return 0;    }}\n\nAnd then you could write your own classes which \"inherit\" from Shape:\n\nclass Circle extends Shape {    float radius;    Circle(float radius) {       \u00a0this.radius = radius;    }    virtual public float area() {        return Math.PI * radius * radius;    }}class Rectangle extends Shape {\n    float base;    float height;\n    Rectangle(float base, float height) {        this.base = base;       \u00a0this.height = height;    }\n    virtual public float area() {\n        return base * height;\n    }\n}\n\nAnd then you can write methods which can take any kind of shape:\n\nclass Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        printArea(new Circle(1.0)); // 3.1415...        printArea(new Rectangle(5.0, 3.0)); // 15.0    }    private static void printArea(Shape shape) {\u00a0      \u00a0System.out.println(\"This shape has area \" + shape.area());    }}\n\nNotes: You shouldn't use inheritance for this, you should use interfaces; this was just a toy example."
